# data8
I audited a foundations of Data Science Course at UC Berkeley. This course focuses on inferential thinking, computational thinking, and real-world relevance. This repository contains my code for each of the projects. 

Project 1: I explored data from Gapminder.org, to investigate a fact-based view of the world and how it has changed through global population growth and the effects of poverty. 

Project 2: I investigate the major causes of death in the wrold from the past century. I examine cardiovascular health in the Framingham Heart Study, the effect of hormone replacement therapy on the risk fo coronary heart disease for post-menopausal women using data from the Nurses' Heart Study and Heart and Estrogen-Progestin Replacement Study. And I explore the effect that the consumption of saturated fats has on cardiovascular death rates using data from the National Heart-Diet Study.  

Project 3: In this project I use machine learning to guess whether a movie is a romance or action movie, using only the number of times given words appear int he movies' screenplay. I build a k-nearest-neighbor-classifier and that it on movie data.
